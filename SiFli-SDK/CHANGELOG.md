## Change log since v2.3

## Major Changes
- Update toolchain to support Linux and macOS. Legacy env tool (upgraded to v1.1.2) could still be used on Windows. But it's recommended to use native terminal tool (i.e. PowerShell for Windows) instead of env for development on Windows. Please refer to [install guide](https://docs.sifli.com/projects/sdk/v2.4/sf32lb52x/quickstart/install/script/index.html). New terminal toolchain doesn't support SDK version `<v2.4`. Windows env tool could support all SDK versions.
- Upgrade GCC to GCC 14. Windows env tool contains both GCC 8 and GCC 14. GCC 8 is used by SDK version `<v2.4`. GCC 14 is used by SDK version `>=v2.4`.
- Upgrade Python to Python 3.11. Windows env tool contains both Python 2.7 and Python 3.11. Python 2.7 is used by SDK version `<v2.4`. Python 3.11 is used by SDK version `>=v2.4`
- `middleware/bluetooth` is integrated as submodule. Downloaded zip file doesn't contain the complete code anymore
